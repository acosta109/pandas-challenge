# pandas-challenge
Module 4 Challenge

In this assignment we read in a csv file using pandas and perform calculations with it. The purpose of the assignment was to reinforce our understanding of
pandas DataFrames and how we can manipulate them. We used commands such as 'pd.cut', 'set_index', '.mean()', and a variety of other ways to manipulate and
edit pandas DataFrames.

Going further with this data, we could use matplotlib to create graphs to visualise the data for further the analysis. The only piece of datum that  
could've made this analysis more complete, is the known number of teachers at each school. A fuller conclusion would analyse student-teacher ratios 
and spending. I'm always a bit hesistant of drawing conclusions on spending without a fuller idea of where it's going.
